## Installing dependencies
Project consists of light backend based on express and react based frontend. For both dependencies must be installed separately, because of different dependencies in package.json. We can do it using `npm install` in main catalogue and client catalogue.

## Running project
We can run project by using `npm start` command in main catalogue. Backend api server and frontend with webpack dev server will be run concurrently.

## Links
Although component should be opened automatically by wepack dev server, below are links to separate apps:
